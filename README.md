This is comments and thoughts on Chinese education system

Since the first mail on June 19 2020 to local eduction management gov department, there is no any response from them till now. I am going to wait for 30 days before I send another mail to them, and then wait for another 10 days, then I have to call their phone to push. Stay tuned.

July 15 2020，update. Today I contacted the gov, I feel frustrated because the email address I got in the last call is invalid, and I called 3 different numbers but finally get the real interface guy's number, the record is attached. In the call, the interface guy suggesst I made a sample protocol of my propsosal, I feel OK, because these guys are just an representitives of the people, I feel happy that I can present my thoughts to them, this is good, because they still open their ear for people's sounds, let's see what will happen next. I will formulate the protocol and upload later. Stay tuned, we, the people!   A comment from a wechater: "让我猜想一下局面: 首先会经历层层系统调用和虚拟机转换，里面也许有真调用，也有假调用，甚至直接halt，经历层层困难后可能真找到了这个物理处理器，那么也许你的建议最后能不能被采纳，完全看当时这个决策者"领导"的心情，和从他视角看是否会损害他本人或者他控制的系统的利益而定？", anyway, I still have hope on Chinese education system, though the politics suck, but I have to fight before I die for nothing.
