This is comments and thoughts on Chinese education system

Since the first mail on June 19 2020 to local eduction management gov department, there is no any response from them till now. I am going to wait for 30 days before I send another mail to them, and then wait for another 10 days, then I have to call their phone to push. Stay tuned.

July 15 2020ï¼Œupdate. Today I contacted the gov, I feel frustrated because the email address I got in the last call is invalid, and I called 3 different numbers but finally get the real interface guy's number, the record is attached. In the call, the interface guy suggesst I made a sample protocol of my propsosal, I feel OK, because these guys are just an representitives of the people, I feel happy that I can present my thoughts to them, this is good, because they still open their ear for people's sounds, let's see what will happen next. I will formulate the protocol and upload later. Stay tuned, we, the people!
