This is comments and thoughts on Chinese education system. I made a ppt file expressing my thoughts. Trying to do something before I die with doing nothing to this socioty. A citizen is responsible for the city, to be a human, not to be a pig whose life is just eating and sleeping and playing, that's big shame.

I update all my speech, mail content, here, after I was made "嫖娼“, everybody can understand what I did from here.

Key events trace below: 

Since the first mail on June 19 2020 to local eduction management gov department, there is no any response from them till now. I am going to wait for 30 days before I send another mail to them, and then wait for another 10 days, then I have to call their phone to push. Stay tuned.

July 15 2020，update. Today I contacted the gov, I feel frustrated because the email address I got in the last call is invalid, and I called 3 different numbers but finally get the real interface guy's number, the record is attached. In the call, the interface guy suggesst I made a sample protocol of my propsosal, I feel OK, because these guys are just an representitives of the people, I feel happy that I can present my thoughts to them, this is good, because they still open their ear for people's sounds, let's see what will happen next. I will formulate the protocol and upload later. Stay tuned, we, the people!   A comment from a wechater: "让我猜想一下局面: 首先会经历层层系统调用和虚拟机转换，里面也许有真调用，也有假调用，甚至直接halt，经历层层困难后可能真找到了这个物理处理器，那么也许你的建议最后能不能被采纳，完全看当时这个决策者"领导"的心情，和从他视角看是否会损害他本人或者他控制的系统的利益而定？", anyway, I still have hope on Chinese education system, though the politics suck, but I have to fight before I die for nothing.

New version of ppt sent to the gov today, will call to notify this afternoon. Jul 17,2020

July 20, 2020. The interface guy received the mail, but didn't read the ppt file yet, and planned to see me recently. 

July 22, 2020. Today I made a date with the interface guy, will meet her at July 24 14:00.

July 23, 2020. The meeting pushed ahead to Thursday afternoon. I had a one hour talk with Miss Li, who is in charge of Teacher's discipline, the final decesion is she accepted my proposal of the 3-head protocol, and I asked her to put this into reality at this year, at September. It seems this can be done. We also discussed the other problems of teachers, but no tangible proposal yet from me. The audio record is attached.

At the end she invited her colleague who is in charge of hiring teachers. I had a two hour talk with him, he is a CCP member,so I can feel a strong ccp style from his speech, for me, I have been used to this. My main opinion is: 
1.  how to hire a teacher who is really want to contribute to education. He feedback that quite some candidates want to be a teachder only for a stable job, or a good job title, etc. He alos pointed out that it's hard to judge a candidate at the interview phase. He also pointed out that the male teachder's ratio is too low, I share the same opinion on this. I asked why, he said the Chinese male has a shame feeling of being a teacher, they think a teacher is woman's job, a man should be more valuable for example more money and higher society position, which I fully understand and indentify. This is a society problem, but still related to education, but it's too far to be discussed for this. We spent quite some time on discussing this, I said why don't change the interview items to be more realistic against the teacher's character, he said it's hard. I also recommend to build another rail, a more commercial rail to attrack really teachers who don't care the good benefit of civil servant or stable job, he said it's hard to do this inside the public school, but he said the none-govermental school can hold this role, which I agree. It seems my dream of being an teacher can be fufilled via this way. He also said the public school run by goverment cannot accept teacher whose age is above 35 years old, I think this is not a good policy, but it's a contry level policy.

we also discussed other topics, I shared my opinion that the society focus too much on the education qualifications, ignored too much in the real capabilities of candidates, this is the reason why lots of parents push their child to paticipate out-side-school training one after another. If the society can spend more cost of building a precise interview system process, some problems can be relieved, this should be a long term benefit for all of the society.

I cannot attach the record because we discussed some sensitive topics, and I don't want any trouble for him or me. So, stay tuned for the next steps for the proposal of the 3-head protocol's deployment. Thanks for your eyes on this project, let's make Chinese education system better.

July 24, 2020. I received a call from www.suomahua.org.cn, who is a charity focusing on education, I registerd my personal information onto their web, in order to do something to help those children who can't affoard education. The call record is attached.
