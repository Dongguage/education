This is comments and thoughts on Chinese education system. I made a ppt file expressing my thoughts. Trying to do something before I die with doing nothing to this socioty. A citizen is responsible for the city, to be a human, not to be a pig whose life is just eating and sleeping and playing, that's big shame.

I update all my speech, mail content, here, after I was made "嫖娼“, everybody can understand what I did from here.

Key events trace below: 

Since the first mail on June 19 2020 to local eduction management gov department, there is no any response from them till now. I am going to wait for 30 days before I send another mail to them, and then wait for another 10 days, then I have to call their phone to push. Stay tuned.

July 15 2020，update. Today I contacted the gov, I feel frustrated because the email address I got in the last call is invalid, and I called 3 different numbers but finally get the real interface guy's number, the record is attached. In the call, the interface guy suggesst I made a sample protocol of my propsosal, I feel OK, because these guys are just an representitives of the people, I feel happy that I can present my thoughts to them, this is good, because they still open their ear for people's sounds, let's see what will happen next. I will formulate the protocol and upload later. Stay tuned, we, the people!   A comment from a wechater: "让我猜想一下局面: 首先会经历层层系统调用和虚拟机转换，里面也许有真调用，也有假调用，甚至直接halt，经历层层困难后可能真找到了这个物理处理器，那么也许你的建议最后能不能被采纳，完全看当时这个决策者"领导"的心情，和从他视角看是否会损害他本人或者他控制的系统的利益而定？", anyway, I still have hope on Chinese education system, though the politics suck, but I have to fight before I die for nothing.

New version of ppt sent to the gov today, will call to notify this afternoon. Jul 17,2020

July 20, 2020. The interface guy received the mail, but didn't read the ppt file yet, and planned to see me recently. 

July 22, 2020. Today I made a date with the interface guy, will meet her at July 24 14:00.

July 23, 2020. The meeting pushed ahead to Thursday afternoon. I had a one hour talk with Miss Li, who is in charge of Teacher's discipline, the final decesion is she accepted my proposal of the 3-head protocol, and I asked her to put this into reality at this year, at September. It seems this can be done. We also discussed the other problems of teachers, but no tangible proposal yet from me. The audio record is attached.

At the end she invited her colleague who is in charge of hiring teachers. I had a two hour talk with him, he is a CCP member,so I can feel a strong ccp style from his speech, for me, I have been used to this. My main opinion is: 
1.  how to hire a teacher who is really want to contribute to education. He feedback that quite some candidates want to be a teachder only for a stable job, or a good job title, etc. He alos pointed out that it's hard to judge a candidate at the interview phase. He also pointed out that the male teachder's ratio is too low, I share the same opinion on this. I asked why, he said the Chinese male has a shame feeling of being a teacher, they think a teacher is woman's job, a man should be more valuable for example more money and higher society position, which I fully understand and indentify. This is a society problem, but still related to education, but it's too far to be discussed for this. We spent quite some time on discussing this, I said why don't change the interview items to be more realistic against the teacher's character, he said it's hard. I also recommend to build another rail, a more commercial rail to attrack really teachers who don't care the good benefit of civil servant or stable job, he said it's hard to do this inside the public school, but he said the none-govermental school can hold this role, which I agree. It seems my dream of being an teacher can be fufilled via this way. He also said the public school run by goverment cannot accept teacher whose age is above 35 years old, I think this is not a good policy, but it's a contry level policy.

we also discussed other topics, I shared my opinion that the society focus too much on the education qualifications, ignored too much in the real capabilities of candidates, this is the reason why lots of parents push their child to paticipate out-side-school training one after another. If the society can spend more cost of building a precise interview system process, some problems can be relieved, this should be a long term benefit for all of the society.

I cannot attach the record because we discussed some sensitive topics, and I don't want any trouble for him or me. So, stay tuned for the next steps for the proposal of the 3-head protocol's deployment. Thanks for your eyes on this project, let's make Chinese education system better.

July 24, 2020. I received a call from www.suomahua.org.cn, who is a charity focusing on education, I registerd my personal information onto their web, in order to do something to help those children who can't affoard education. The call record is attached.

Aug 13，2020. I donated ￥20,000 to a charity org, 18,700 of it will be donated directly to 12 students, 10% of the fund will be used as operational expenses. And 1300 of it is donated to the org itself. Each year I will continue to donate, until I loose my job or fortune.

Aug 31 2020. 我可能已经失败了。开学并没有收到任何三方协议签署。在微信里给教育局接口人留了言询问，一天没有回复。我可能高估了这个系统的能力，抱有了不切实际的幻想。

2020-09-02 索性不用中文了，之前用英文是想增加一些被审查的难度对自己保护一下。但是也提升了阅读门槛。今早送孩子，路上孩子跟我说她班上有个同学总是无故喊叫，每次老师总是批评对方，瞪眼，而且威胁说再叫的话，中午吃饭就让他背对着屏幕吃不准看动画片。我心里顿时咯噔一下，我深知这孩子患有妥瑞氏症或者抽动症。我跟孩子说，这是一种疾病，同学并不是故意的，他忍不住，我让孩子偷偷跟这个同学说，可以去医院看看的，吃点药可能会好一些，就不会被老师批评了。不知道我这个做法是不是出力不讨好，鲁迅说过，“我向来不以最大的恶来揣测中国人”，但是我依然得做。这个症状，很多孩子都有，包括我孩子也有偶发轻微症状，尤其是紧张的时候。这是个值得重视的问题，我一开始就在ppt中写了要求每一个老师都成为半个儿童心理健康师。我对这个孩子深表同情，对他的家长也深表同情。于是我今早联系了12345要求针对全市教师进行这方面的普及，抽动症，多动症，弱视斜视等等儿童常见生理心理疾病，应该怎么应对。美国有个电影叫做《叫我第一名》，讲了一个真实故事，一个患有抽动症乱喊叫的人最终当了老师，据我所知美国对这个疾病，老师都是在全班上公开给学生们讲，这是一种疾病，没有什么可耻笑的。而我国的集体主义和封建教育，基本就是个排除异类追求最高劳动效率的集中营，人是不被当成人看的。美国对人的尊重，对不同东西的包容，坑可能是是永远学不会的。另外，我对边吃边看动画片也有很大意见，这会影响儿童的消化系统。可以听歌，听故事，都可以。看，是不行的。 这些老师急需一场心理健康教育。

通过打12345的录音就可以知道，这14亿蛆是一种什么思维方式，我说我班上有这种情况，她就让我提供班级信息，我说这是个普适性的工作，她说不提供信息怎么对老师进行培训。这是什么思维？按闹分配。谁受不了了，跪求大老爷了，就施舍一点点。而且对方流露出轻蔑的语气。普世价值的理想，却被嘲笑。

去卫健委网站查了一下，有妇幼保健科室，老年科室，唯独没有儿童和青少年科室。可能卫健委不太重视心理健康。
